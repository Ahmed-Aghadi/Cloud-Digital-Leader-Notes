[Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)

# Main Points

-   As the evolution of Container Registry, Artifact Registry is a single place for your organization to **manage container images** and language packages (such as Maven and npm). It is fully integrated with Google Cloudâ€™s tooling and runtimes and comes with support for native artifact protocols. This makes it simple to integrate it with your CI/CD tooling to set up automated pipelines.
-   Secure and consistent
-   Automate building and deployment
