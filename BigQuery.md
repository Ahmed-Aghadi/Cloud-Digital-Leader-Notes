# Main Points

(Cloud SQL -> transactional
BigQuery -> analytical)

-   pay for the data you store and the queries you perform
-   **Analytics**
-   enterprise **data warehouse** for large amounts of relational structured data
-   Serverless
-   highly scalable
-   secure platform
-   built-in machine learning (BigQuery ML)
-   BigQuery ML lets you create and **execute machine learning models** in BigQuery **using standard SQL queries**. BigQuery ML democratizes machine learning by letting SQL practitioners build models using existing SQL tools and skills. BigQuery ML increases development speed by eliminating the need to move data.
