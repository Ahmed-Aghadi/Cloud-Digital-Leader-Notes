[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

# Main Points

(An enterprise might have complex microservice-based applications that require advanced configuration features of GKE, and some that do not, but that still want to take advantage of Cloud Run’s ease of use and scalability [Reference](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/when-to-use-google-kubernetes-engine-vs-cloud-run-for-containers))

-   Develop and deploy highly scalable containerized applications
-   ease of use and scalability (not for complex applications, as for that use Google Kubernetes Engine)
-   Any language, any library, any binary
-   Pay‐per‐use
-   serverless
