### points from comments

-   Google Container Registry(GCR) provides a private image registry which behind the scenes uses Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
-   Automatically build and push images to private registry when you commit code to Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket. Easily set up CI/CD pipelines with integration to Cloud Build or deploy directly to Google Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, Cloud Functions, or Firebase.
